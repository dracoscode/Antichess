 # AntiChess

This repository contains code for an AI-enhanced variant of the classic chess game implemented in Python. This project introduces a new rule to standard chess, adding an additional layer of strategic depth to the game. The rule is as follows: "If a player has a legal move that captures an opponent's piece, the player must execute a capturing move."

# Project Overview

The variant chess game project aims to challenge and enhance both AI and human strategies by introducing a new rule to the classic chess game. The project was built from scratch and showcases advanced algorithms such as the Minimax algorithm, Alpha-beta pruning, and Evaluation functions.

- Program will ask for a input black or white to choose side.
- Need an input (eg. 'a2a3')  to push a move for opponent each round.
- '1-0' or '0-1' will be printed if exists checkmate, '1/2-1/2' will be printed if there is no availiable move while not    checkmated or three-repetitions or 50-move rule.

The games are set up to run automatically between two AI programs, requiring only an initial input from the user.

# Features

Chess Engine: Engine developed from scratch that governs all the rules of the variant chess game.
AI Opponents: Games are conducted between two AI programs with sophisticated decision-making algorithms.
Advanced Algorithms: Utilizes algorithms like Minimax and Alpha-beta pruning for decision making.
Evaluation Function: Employs evaluation functions for AI to assess the state of the game and make strategic decisions.
High Performance: The implemented algorithm scored in the 90th percentile out of over 200 competitive participants.
